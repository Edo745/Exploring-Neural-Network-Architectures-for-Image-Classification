# Neural Network Architectures: Implementation and Comparison

This repository contains the implementation and comparison of three neural network architectures: a simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and a ResNet architecture. The aim is to explore and analyze their performance on a standard dataset, providing insights into their strengths and weaknesses for different types of tasks, particularly image classification.

A key objective of this project is to understand how skip connections work in deeper architectures like ResNet, and to assess how they help mitigate the vanishing gradient problem, which often affects very deep networks.

## Introduction

Neural networks are widely used in machine learning for tasks like image classification, object detection, and more. This repository demonstrates the implementation of three key architectures:
1. **MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron):** A simple feedforward neural network.
2. **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network):** Designed for image data, with layers that capture spatial hierarchies.
3. **ResNet (Residual Network):** A deeper architecture that uses skip connections to address the vanishing gradient problem.

The goal is to compare the performance of these architectures on the same dataset and analyze their trade-offs in terms of complexity, accuracy, and training time.

## Architectures

1. **MLP**  
   A basic feedforward neural network with fully connected layers. This is typically used for non-sequential data but can also be applied to flattened image data.

2. **CNN**  
   This network uses convolutional layers to automatically learn spatial features from the input images, followed by fully connected layers for classification.

3. **ResNet**  
   ResNet introduces residual connections (skip connections) to allow gradients to flow more easily through deeper networks, enabling better performance for more complex tasks.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation is [insert dataset name, e.g., MNIST or CIFAR-10]. It contains [describe dataset contents], and it's commonly used for benchmarking deep learning models.

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

1. Python 3.x
2. PyTorch or TensorFlow (depending on the implementation)
3. NumPy
4. Matplotlib (for visualizations)

### Install required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
cd repository-name
```

Run the training script for each model:

- For MLP:

  ```bash
  python train_mlp.py
  ```

- For CNN:

## Results

After training the models, the results, including accuracy, loss curves, and computational complexity, are compared and visualized.

### Performance Metrics:

- **MLP:**  
  Accuracy: X%, Training Time: X minutes  
- **CNN:**  
  Accuracy: Y%, Training Time: Y minutes  
- **ResNet:**  
  Accuracy: Z%, Training Time: Z minutes  

A detailed comparison of these metrics can be found in the [results](results) folder.
